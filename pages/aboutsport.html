                  <p>To answer that question we should take a brief dive into the history.</p>
                  <p>In the 19th century, one of the pastimes of nobles, kings and other wealthy people was hunting. When it came to hunting small game, special breeds of dogs were used in order to collect dead game without further damaging it or eating it - retrievers, hence the name of this family of breeds.</p>

                <div class="article-paragraph3">
                  <p>As the culture of using retrievers and other hunting dogs developed, the International Gundog League was formed in 1900 in the British Empire in order to supervise the interests and work on the breed standards of Sporting Gundogs. It was an amalgamation of 3 separate entities - Retriever Society, Pointer and Setter Society, and Sporting Spaniel Society.</p>

                <div class="article-paragraph4">
                  <p>IGL still exists and thrives today, with its competitions being the most prestigious in the world and equivalent to a World Championship of retriever sport. However, the sport wasn't confined to Britain only - in the second half of 20th century working retriever organizations began forming all across the world. In the US for instance, amateur and more serious competitions were being held since the 1950s by the AKC (American Kennel Club).</p>

                  <p>One could think that retriever sport is bloody, involving shooting a lot of game and thus barbaric. This may have been true in the past, and the most prestigious championships (like IGL) still use exclusively live game to simpulate hunting situations, but nowadays dummies gained widespread use, and the advanced equipment like dummy launchers allow to simulate the passing birds and even entire flocks of them. So if you were hesitating to try our sport out just because of that - don't you worry!</p>

                <div class="article-paragraph7">
                  <p>Nowadays working retriever sport includes hunt trainings, agility, work in line, on water, difficult ground and outside the handler's visibility. Competitions include:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Field Trials - these simulate real-life hunting, so FTs use live game.</li>                    
                    <li>Dummy Trials - these are essentially FTs, but with dummies. Perfect for those who don't want to deal with dead game.</li>
                    <li>Working Tests - could be done either with cold game or with dummies.</li>
                    <li>NomeA & NomeB - Finnish version of working tests, usually more rigorous and extensive.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Our club members regularly participate and organize all of these types of competition, as well as prepartation for them, so if you'd like to experience them yourself, then you'd be right at home with us!</p>
